        <h3>Transform</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            "transform" property allows you to translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew
            any element on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            "translation" property allows you to move elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "scaled" element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in
            other words, the element’s center will stay in the same place as its dimensions
            change.
        </p>
        <p>
            "rotate()"" function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified
            angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element’s center.angles are declared in
            degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise
            and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be
            provided in grads, radians, or turns,
        </p>
        <p>
            The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect,
            the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If
            the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis
        </p>
        <p>
            transforms are applied in the order given.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can control the origin from which your transforms are applied. This is done using the transform-origin
            property.
        </p>

        <h3>Transitions</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native
            CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they’ll usually appear
            smoother. On mobile devices with limited computing power, this can be a lifesaver.
        </p>

        <p>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:</p>
        <ul>
            <ol>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</ol>
            <ol>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</ol>
            <ol>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the
                transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration,
                transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of
                these and how they work shortly.</ol>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You can provide any number of CSS properties to the transition-property declaration,
            separated by commas. Alternatively, you can use the keyword all to indicate
            that every supported property should be animated as it transitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the properties in the shorthand syntax can be in any order, however, if a
            delay is included, you must also include a duration, and the duration must precede
            the delay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s say instead of just transitioning the rotation, we transition the text’s color
            property as well. We’d have to first include a color property in the transitioned
            style declaration, and then either add the color property in the transition-property
            value list, or use the key term all:<br>
            transition-property: transform, color;
        </p>

        <h3>Animations</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. With CSS
            transitions, we’re essentially limited to defining a first and a last keyframe. CSS animations allow
            us to add any number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation in more
            complex ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name. You want
            to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such as forwards,
            running, or alternate. Those three key terms in particular have caused many
            developers hours of debugging.
        </p>

        <h3>Canvas</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must also be
            set. The width and height attributes determine how large the canvas’s coordinate
            system is. If we don’t specify width and height, the canvas element will default
            to a width of 300 and a height of 150. If we set the width and height for a canvas
            only in CSS, the canvas element will be 300 by 150, and the CSS properties will
            simply determine how large the box is that displays the image.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the canvas is 200 pixels by 200
            pixels, then the bottom-right corner is (200,200)
        </p>


        <span class="target"></span>

        <h3>SVG</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike canvas, images created with SVG are available via the DOM. This enables
            technologies such as screen readers to see what’s present in an SVG object through
            itsDOMnode, as well as allowing you to inspect SVG using your browser’s developer
            tools.
        </p>

        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 400">
            <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red" />
        </svg>
        <svg xmlns1="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 400 400">
            <desc>Drawing a rectangle</desc>
            <rect x="5" y="5" width="75" height="75" fill="blue" stroke="red" stroke-width="3" />
        </svg>

        <p>
            One open source tool that you can use to make SVG images is Inkscape
        </p>
