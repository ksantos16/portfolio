    <section>
        <h3>Programming Basics</h3>
        <p>
        <h4>Comments</h4>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        Multi-line comments start with /* and finish with */:
        <br>
        <h4>Block</h4>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces
        <br>
        Blocks do not need to be terminated by a semicolon at the end.
        <br>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <br>
        Hello alert message that appear when the page is open
        <span class="blockStatement"></span>

        <h4>Data Types</h4>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        JavaScript has seven different data types.
        <br>
        Any value that is not one of the primitive data types listed above is an <strong>object</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Six of them are primitive data types and
        are listed below:

        <li>String</li>
        <li>Symbol</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>Null</li>

        <h4>Operator</h4>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        JavaScript has a special operator called <strong>typeof</strong>, for finding out the type of a value.<br>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <p class="typesOfOperators"></p>

        <h4>Variables</h4>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        If the variable references a non-primitive data type, such as an array, function or
        object, then using const will not make it immutable. This means the underlying
        data inside the object can change (known as mutating the object). We can see this
        in the example below:<br><br>
        const name = { value: 'Alexa' }; // an object
        <br><br>
        Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope.<bR>
        If let or const are not used, the variable will have global scope

        <h4>Methods </h4>
        <strong>Notes:</strong><br>
        Write a string in all capital letters using the toUpperCase() method: <br>
        <span class="upper"></span>
        <br>
        The toLowerCase() method, which will write my name in all lower-case letters:<br>
        <span class="lower"></span>
        <br>
        To know which character is at a certain position, you can use the charAt() method: <br>
        <span class="position"></span>
        <br>
        (This tells us that the character ‘l’ in Alexa is at position 1.).
        <br><br>
        To find where a certain character or substring appears in a string, we can use the indexOf() method: <br>
        <span class="index1"></span>
        <br>
        <span class="index2"></span>
        <br>
        If a character doesn’t appear in the string, -1 will be returned: <br>
        <br>
        Want the last occurrence of a character or substring, we can use the lastIndexOf() method:
        <br>
        <span class="last"></span>
        <br>
        Want to know if a string contains a certain character, we can use the includes() method:
        <br>
        <span class="includes1"></span>
        <br>
        <span class="includes2"></span>
        <br>
        A couple of methods to check if a string starts or ends in a particular character. To check if a string
        starts with a certain character, we can use the startsWith() method.
        <br>
        <span class="starts1"></span>
        <br>
        <span class="starts2"></span>
        <br>
        (note: Be careful though, its case-sensitive)
        <br>
        And we can use the similar endsWith() method to check if a string ends with a particular character:<br>
        <span class="ends1"></span>
        <br>
        <span class="ends2"></span>
        <br>
        The concat() method can be used to concatenate two or more strings together:
        <br>
        <span class="concat1"></span>
        <br>
        <span class="concat2"></span>
        <br>
        A shortcut for string concatenation is to use the + operator to add the two strings together:
        <br>
        <span class="concat3"></span>
        <br>
        The trim() method will remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of a string:
        <br>
        <span class="trim1"></span>
        <br>
        <span class="trim2"></span>
        <br>
        The repeat() method that will repeat a string the stated number of times: <br>
        <span class="repeat"></span>


        <h4>Template Literals</h4>
        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        Use (\n): to make a line break

        <h4>Symbols</h4>
        Ex.<br>
        const uniqueID = Symbol('this is a unique ID');<br><br>
        The main use-case for symbols is as object property keys
        <br>

        <h4>Numbers</h4>
        The toFixed() method rounds a number to a fixed number of decimal places:<br>
        The toPrecision() method rounds a number to a fixed number of significant figures<br>

        <h4>Logic Operator</h4>
        !(Logic Not)
        !!(find out if a value it truthy or falsy)
        <br>
        && (Logic And)
        <br>
        ||(Logic Or)
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Array</h4>
        <p>The shift() method works in a similar way to the pop() method, but this
            removes the first item in the array and the unshift() method is similar to the push() method, but this
            appends a new item to the beginning of the array:
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples:
            <span class="array"></span>
            <br>
            <span class="array2"></span>
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Sets</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Notes:</strong>
            A set is a data structure that
            represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate
            values.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Maps</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Notes:</strong>
            Maps a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to
            “hashes”, or“hash tables” or “dictionaries” in other programming languages.
            <br>
            Maps can use any data type as a key.
            <br>
            The value of an object’s properties can be accessed directly, whereas maps restrict you to using the get()
            method to retrieve any values.
