    <h2>Week Nine - JS: The Window Object and HTML5 APIs</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>The Browser History</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited
            before arriving at the current page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0
            is the current page:
        </p>

        <h3>Screen Information</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows you to do things
            like turn off the device's screen, detect a change in its orientation or lock it in a
            specific orientation.
        </p>

        <p>
            These practices have (thankfully) now been superseded by better practices, such as media queries
            and feature detection, which is covered in the next chapter.
        </p>

        <h3>Timing Functions</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first
            parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to
            window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function
            after every given number of milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be careful when using a method that uses the this keyword with either of these
            timing methods. The binding of this is set to the window object, rather than the
            method's object, so it can get some unexpected results
        </p>

        <h3></h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom
            attributes that are ignored by the browser.
        </p>
        <ul>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use
            the following format:
            <li>
                Start with data-.
            </li>
            <li>
                Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or
                underscores.
            </li>
            <li>
                Include an optional string value.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Examples could be:<br><br>
            data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'<br>
            data-rating = '5'<br>
            data-dropdown<br>
            data-user = 'DAZ'<br>
            data-max-length = '32'<br>
        </p>

        <div id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'>
            Superman
        </div>

        <p>
            To access the attribute, powers is used as
            if it’s a property of the dataset object. If a data- attribute’s name contains
            hyphens, they are replaced with camel-case notation, so data-max-length would
            be accessed using dataset.maxLength.
        </p>

        <h3>LocalStorage</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The event object sent by the
            event listener to the callback has a number of properties that provide information
            about the updated item:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                key tells us the key of the item that changed
            </li>
            <li>
                newValue tells us the new value to which it has been changed
            </li>
            <li>
                oldValue tells us the previous value before it was changed
            </li>
            <li>
                storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Geolocation</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.
            This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby
            places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.
