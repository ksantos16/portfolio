        <h3>FORMS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Input element with a type attribute of image <br>
            input type='image' src='button.png'
        </p>
        <p>
            The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s
            sent to a different URL to be processed on the server:<br>
            form.action = '/an/other.url'
        </p>

        <form name='search' action='/search'>
            <input name='searchInput'>
            <button type='submit'>Search</button>
        </form>

        <h3> RETRIEVING & CHANGING VALUES FROM A FORMS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the
            text inside the field.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can use this to report back what the user has searched for. Edit the search()
        </p>

        <input type='text' name='search-box' placeholder='Search Here'>
        <p>
            placeholder text is not actually a value of the input field, so it won’t be submitted as the field’s value
            if the user fails to fill it in
        </p>

    </section>

        <h3>FORM CONTROLS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The autofocus attribute give focus to this element when a page loads. It is the
            equivalent to putting the following line of JavaScript in main.js:<br>
            document.forms.hero.heroName.focus();
        </p>
        <p>
            The maxlength attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in
            the field to the value given (in this case 32).
        </p>

        <form id='hero'>
            <label for='heroName'>Name:
                <input type='text' id='heroName' name='heroName' autofocus placeholder='Your Super Hero Name'
                    maxlength=32>
            </label>

            <label for='realName'>Real Name:
                <input type='password' name='realName' id='realName'>
            </label>

            <button type='submit' id='submit' disabled>Submit</button>

        </form>

        <h3>INPUT FIELDS</h3>

        <h3>BUTTONS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The other type is simply button. This doesn’t need to be inside a form element
            and has no default behavior. It simply creates a clickable button that can have an
            event listener attached to it:<br>
            button type='button'>Click Me >button
        </p>
    </section>

        <h3>OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Encapsulation: : the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities
            are exposed to the end user
        </p>

        <p> Polymorphism: various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared
            methods with a more specific implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Inheritance: can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then
            improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.
        </p>

        <p>
            Classes: to define a blueprint for an object.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The parentheses are not required when instantiating a new object using a
            constructor function. The following code would also achieve the same result:<br>
            const redDice = new Dice;<br>
            The parentheses are required, however, if any default arguments need to be
            provided.<br>
            For example, if we want to create another Dice object with four sides, we would
            have to add 4 as an argument, like so:<br>
            const whiteDice = new Dice(4);
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>CONSTRUCTOR PROPERTY</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            We can use the constructor property to instantiate a copy of an object, without
            having to reference the actual constructor function or class declaration directly.
        </p>

        <p>
            We must use bracket notation when accessing keys that have numbers, spaces, or special characters in them.
            Without bracket notation in these situations, our code would throw an error.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>STATIC METHODS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method.
            These are sometimes called class methods in other programming languages.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties
            or methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class
        </p>

        <p>
            The prototype object is live, so if a new property or method is added to the
            prototype, any instances of its class will inherit the new properties and methods
            automatically, even if that instance has already been created.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>GETTING AND SETTING PROPERTY DESCRIPTORS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Instead of using assignment, we can add properties to an object using the
            Object.defineProperty() method. This provides more fine-grained control
            when adding new properties, as it allows each attribute to be set. The first
            argument is the object to which you want to add the property, followed by a
            property descriptor containing the attributes you want to set.
        </p>

        <p>
            These getter and setter methods allow much more fine-grained control over how
            assignment works. It also means we can change the way assignment works, and
            use the get() method to return anything we like, regardless of what value was set
            using assignment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The get and set property descriptors are particularly useful for controlling the
            getting and setting of properties in classes.
        </p>

    </section>

        <h3>CREATING OBJECTS FROM OTHER OBJECTS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The Object() constructor function has a method called create that can be used
            to create a new object that is an exact copy of the object that is provided as an
            argument. The object that is provided as the argument acts as the prototype for
            the new object.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Object.create() will create a new object that inherits all the properties and methods being called in
            the ()
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>OBJECT-BASED INHERITANCE</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The initial values are passed as an argument
            to the constructor function. This can be fixed by adding a init() method
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>OBJECT PROTOTYPE CHAIN</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Every time a new object is created using the Object.create() method, the new
            object inherits all the properties and methods from the parent object, which
            becomes the new object’s prototype.
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>BINDINGS</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            The value of this points to the object calling a method. It
            allows us to create generalized methods that refer to properties specific to a
            particular object. Be aware of a certain problem when a function is nested inside
            another function, which can often happen when using methods in objects,
            especially ones that accept callback functions. The problem is that the value of
            this loses its scope, and points to the global object inside a nested function,
        </p>

        <p>
            Use that = this: A common solution is to set the variable that to equal this before the nested
            function, and refer to that in the nested function instead of this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use bind(this): The bind() method is a method for all functions and is used to set the value of
            this in the function. If this is provided as an argument to bind() while it’s still
            in scope, any reference to this inside the nested function will be bound to the
            object calling the original method
        </p>

        <p>
            Use the for-of: for arrays and this does not require a nested
            function to be used
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>LIBRARIES</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it
            easier to achieve common tasks. A library will abstract functionality into easier-to-use
            functions and methods. These can then be used to complete common tasks
            without having to use lots of repetitive code.
        </p>
        <p>
            jQuery: The jQuery library uses the $ symbol as a convenient alias for the the global
            jQuery object that contains all of jQuery’s methods. This prevents the global scope
            from being polluted with any of jQuery’s methods. The $ symbol has become
            synonymous with jQuery, and you can confidently expect that any mention of it
            implies that jQuery is being used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Underscore & Lodash: using one of these libraries in your projects as it will give
            you access to a large number of well-tested utility functions that are often
            required in projects, and particularly geared towards a functional style of
            programming
        </p>

        <h3>MODULAR JAVASCRIPT</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods
            that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code
            organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability. The
            code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions
            with distinct functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Coupling: The coupling of code refers to how dependent certain elements or modules of code
            are on each other. Two pieces of code are said to be tightly coupled if one relies on
            the other to run. This often occurs if a piece of code makes hard-coded references to
            another piece of code, requiring it to be used. This will often mean that changes to
            one piece of code will necessitate changes in the other.

        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few important points about modules that are worth keeping in mind:
            <li>
                All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use
                strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.
            </li>
            <li>
                A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of
                a module can only be accessed within that module.
            </li>
            <li>
                The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined, rather than the
                global object.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can’t use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn’t very
                common in any JavaScript program these days).
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are lots of values and functions that need to be imported, then everything
            in a module file can be imported using the wildcard symbol * along with a
            namespace for the imported values and functions using the following notation:<br>
            import * as stats from './stats.js';
        </p>
        <p>
            Default exports refer to a single variable, function or class in a module that can be
            imported without having to be explicitly named. The syntax for default exports is
            purposely easier to read because this is how modules were designed to be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't Use More Than One Default Export
            Having more than one default export will result in a syntax error.
        </p>
        <p>
            With default exports is that you don’t need to use curly braces
            or make any mention of the value that is being imported, making the statement
            read more elegantly
        </p>

        <h3>MVC FRAMEWORK</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <p>
            Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time
            in server-side languages. It’s a common way of designing software, and used by
            server-side frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and Django. In recent years it has
            been used in JavaScript code to make it easier to organize large-scale web
            applications.
        </p>

        <li>
            Models are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading,
            updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information
            about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior. In a
            to-do list application, for example, there would be a task model providing
            methods to access all the information about the tasks such as names, due dates
            and completed tasks. This data will often be stored in a database or some
            other container.
        </li>

        <li>
            Views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant
            information. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a
            web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application,
            usually via forms. In a to-do list application, the views would display the
            tasks as an HTML list with checkboxes that a user could tick to say a task had
            been completed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them.
            They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some
            data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the model
            and view accordingly. In a to-do list application, the controller functions
            would respond to the event of a user clicking on a check box and then inform
            the model that a task had been completed. The model would then update the
            information about that task.
        </li>
