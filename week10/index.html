            <li>
                required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted
            </li>
            <li>
                minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)
            </li>
            <li>
                min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types
            </li>
            <li>
                type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset
                type.
            </li>
            <li>
                pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The textarea element doesn't support the pattern attribute.

                     and therefore only one radio button in a same-named group having the "required"
                     attribute suffices in making a selection a requirement -->

                   don't implement the number input type but support the pattern attribute.
                   Please note that browsers that support the pattern attribute will make it
                   fail silently when used with a number field.
                   Its usage here acts only as a fallback -->

        <h3>Using Fetch API</h3>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>

        <h3>fetch () Parameters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>resource: defines the resource that you wish to fetch. This can either be:</li>

            <p>A string or any other object with a stringifier — including a URL object — that provides the URL of the
                resource you want to fetch.</p>

            <p>A Request object.</p>

            <li>init: An object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the request. The possible
                options are:</li>

            <li>method: The request method, e.g., GET, POST. Note that the Origin header is not set on Fetch requests
                with a method of HEAD or GET.</li>

            <li>headers: Any headers you want to add to your request, contained within a Headers object or an object
                literal with String values.</li>

            <li>body: Any body that you want to add to your request: this can be a Blob, an ArrayBuffer, a TypedArray, a
                DataView, a FormData, a URLSearchParams, string object or literal, or a ReadableStream object. Note that
                a request using the GET or HEAD method cannot have a body.</li>

            <li>mode: The mode you want to use for the request, e.g., cors, no-cors, or same-origin.</li>

            <li>Click<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch"> HERE </a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Origin</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only be used
                to request data (they shouldn't include data)</li>

            <li>HEAD method requests the headers that would be returned if the HEAD request's URL was instead requested
                with the HTTP GET method. For example, if a URL might produce a large download, a HEAD request could
                read its Content-Length header to check the filesize without actually downloading the file.</li>

            <li>POST method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the
                Content-Type header.</li>

            <p>The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times
                successively has the same effect (that is no side effect), where successive identical POST may have
                additional effects, like passing an order several times.</p>

            <p>A POST request is typically sent via an HTML form and results in a change on the server.</p>

        <h3>Question</h3>

        <p>Why do some developers say its best to use async and await? When we would still have to use a .then to use
            the promise</p>
